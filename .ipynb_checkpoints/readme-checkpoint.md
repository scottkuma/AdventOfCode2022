# Advent Of Code 2022

## Notes:

### Day 01:
Yes, I could have done this more simply.  I like using objects, and wanted to practice with them, because I knew they would be important later...

And besides, you never know when work on this might pay off in a different puzzle!

### Day 02:
I'm pretty happy with this one!  Yes, I could have eliminated the "Loses To" in the constructor, since I didn't end up using it.

### Day 03:
String parsing!  Always fun and easy with Python!

### Day 04:
Python makes this one easy with sets.  List comprehension helped with formatting.

### Day 05:
PANDAS's read_fwf (read a fixed length file) made parsing the input string seem like magic!

### Day 06:
More string parsing!  Again, easy in Python if you understand slicing!

### Day 07:
I had WAY too much fun with this one. Again, yes, I probably could have done it more elegantly.  However, who doesn't want to write their own virtual operating system?!  Also, I was kinda hoping that we might build upon this in later puzzles.  (I'm going to have to go back and see how I generated dirlist.txt - it's not really shown in the notebook as saved.)

### Day 08:
I might have been able to do this easier with something other than PANDAS matrices.  HOWEVER, those matrices gave me the ability to:
* transpose the matrix, which let me use the same visibility function for columns and rows
* perform fast operations like logical OR (which I used for visibility)

### Day 09:
FINALLY using some Objects pays off.  Part 1 was simple, but I made it a linked list anyhow...  And that work made Part 2 REALLY simple, as all I had to do was change my constructor a little bit.  Oh, and when they tell you that there's more way that things can move in part 2, they MEAN IT.
